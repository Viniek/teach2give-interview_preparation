# Understanding System Design  
***System design is a step-by-step process of defining a particular software's architecture, modules and components***  
#### Importance of the Concept 
<ol>
<li>Vital in building scalable and reliable software.
<li>Helps tech giant companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon to  check the interviewer's ability to think about building the application's architecture from scratch. 
<li>System design primer helps you to understand the essence of system design and various concepts from basic to advanced.  

#### Steps of Software Development  
<ol>
<li>Identify the requirements:  
- can be functional and non-functional.Non-functional requirements include scalability, high availability and consistency 
<li>System design- Prepare the architecture for the application according to requirements.It includes deciding whether  to use SQL or NoSQL databases based on the data you need to store.
<li>Decide how to make the application scalable in case the traffic increases. You can have multiple servers worldwide and serve the resources to users from the nearest server to make their applications efficient.

#### ***System Design Methods*** 
Developers should choose a particular method based on the project's requirements. 


***1. Architectural Design*** 

- Being the base of the system design, it describes the infrastructure, model, view, components and interaction.  
 - It includes client-server interaction and microservices.
 
 ***2. ERD Diagram(Entity-relationship diagram)***  

 Its uses include:  
 - In designing the application's database structure.
 - Used to define multiple database schemas 
 - Used to add entities in each schema 
 - Used to add multiple attributes for each entity
 - Used to connect the entities of two different schemas if a relationship exists between them. 

 ***3. UML Diagram(Unified modeling language)***  
 - It contains different diagrams like activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams to represent the different aspects of the system.
 - Used to prepare modeling software systems.  

 ***4.Class Diagrams***
-  Used to represent the classes and  provides an overview of the system's data and functionality.
- They can contain the class's attributes, methods and relationships between multiple classes.
